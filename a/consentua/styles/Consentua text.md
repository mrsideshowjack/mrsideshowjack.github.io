Consentua, building Trust through Choice and Control of Personal Data

<Large Image needed>

GDPR is coming!
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will apply in the UK from 25 May 2018. 

It will affect you...
GDPR applies to all organisations that use, store or process personal data. It applies to processing carried out by organisations operating within the EU and organisations outside the EU that offer goods or services to individuals within the EU. 


We can help. Consentua is a consent management tool that allows organisations to create a trust-based relationship with their consumers. 


Although GDPR is not law until May 2018, changes take time and planning. To get up to date fast, call our team on 02392 160640 or email contact@consentua.com

“There’s a lot in the GDPR you’ll recognise from the current law, but make no mistake, this one’s a game changer for everyone” - Elizabeth Denham, Information Commissioner, January 2017



GDPR asks that organisations collect clear, unambiguous consent before processing personal data, and are able to demonstrate that they have done so.  Data subjects will have the right to change their minds and a right to be forgotten.

The government has confirmed that the UK’s decision to leave the EU will not affect the commencement of the GDPR. 

The maximum fine for breaches of the new regulations is €20m or 4% of global turnover.  

Why it affects you
GDPR applies to all organisations that use, store or process personal data. It will help your organisation to enjoy a better, more trustful relationship with your customers which will, in turn, lead to more business.


The first step to GDPR compliance is to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) in your organisation.  

The PIA will establish your organisation’s personal data requirements, it will identify where that personal data is processed and it will set out a privacy policy that you then need to ask customers to agree to.

Talk to us today at 02392 160640 to find out if a PIA is suitable for your organisation.

How Consentua answers the problem

Consentua is an innovative new consent management service. It enables a new relationship between the citizen and the processors of their data. Consentua uses a unique user interface that clearly articulates the equitable exchange between the processor’s use of your data and what the citizen can expect as a result. 

Users can see their historic consents, data processors can see who has which services and interactions have been consented to and by whom. This improves customer satisfaction through greater trust between customer and provider. Consentua thus delivers two benefits - happy customers and a happy data protection officer.  

Sample Use Case

Marketing in this century is becoming ever more personalised. Customers look for ‘Rock Star Service’. This happens when you visit somewhere for the first time and customer service is outstanding, almost as if they know you! A bit like going to your local pub and the landlord pulls your usual pint as you walk through the door. 

Customers want to be known, understood and supplied with great service every time. They buy into trusted brands, they want that relationship.

Consentua assists the marketing team in two areas.  Firstly by helping to deliver rock star service, yet still maintain and add trust between customer and provider. Secondly, Consentua makes it easy to see what can be marketed to the customer and whether you have their consent to receive the latest offer.   


You can see a consent template and begin your journey to a better relationship with your customers by visiting www.consentua.com. Or you can call us on 02392 160640

How Consentua works

1) Consentua is accessed via a simple API (Application Programming Interface)

2) A consent template is created for your organisation - the template describes what information you need to collect from your users.

3) A consent request is presented to your user via an embedded instance of consentua within your application

4) Your user chooses the level of consent they wish to grant.

5) The consent is recorded by Consentua and a consent receipt is made available via the API.

6) Your customer is now free to continue to enjoy your service.
